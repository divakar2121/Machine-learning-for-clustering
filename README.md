# Machine-learning-for-clustering


In my recent project on machine learning for clustering using PyTorch, I generated random data using a seed. I explored both linear and non-linear approaches for developing neural networks to perform clustering.

For the linear regression approach, I meticulously tuned the number of layers and epochs, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99.95%. On the other hand, for the non-linear clustering, I employed a combination of linear transformations and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activations to construct the neural network. This hybrid approach facilitated effective clustering, showcasing the versatility and power of combining linear and non-linear methods in neural network design.
